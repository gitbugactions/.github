# GitBug-Actions

Welcome to GitBug-Actions - We build executable code datasets using GitHub Actions!

## About Us

GitBug-Actions is a research initiative that develops tools for mining and executing software repositories. Our main focus is on creating reproducible bug-fix benchmarks by leveraging GitHub Actions, ensuring that discovered bugs and their fixes can be reliably reproduced in the future.

## Key Projects

### üõ†Ô∏è [gitbugactions](https://github.com/gitbugactions/gitbugactions)
Our flagship tool that mines repositories and builds executable code datasets. It:
- Analyzes GitHub repositories and their commit history
- Executes GitHub Actions locally to extract execution information (e.g., tests)
- Creates Docker images with reproducible environments
- Ensures long-term reproducibility

### ‚òï [gitbug-java](https://github.com/gitbugactions/gitbug-java)
A comprehensive Java bug benchmark featuring recent bugs from real-world projects:
- [Web Interface](https://nfsaavedra.github.io/gitbug-java)
- Available on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/gitbugactions/gitbug-java)
- Fully reproducible environment with Docker support
- Detailed test execution results and metadata
